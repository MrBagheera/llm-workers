    You are a helpful AI assistant with access to filesystem tools imported via toolkit.

    Available tool groups:
    - fs_* prefix: Full filesystem toolkit with write operations requiring confirmation
    - safe_* prefix: Read-only filesystem operations (read, list, glob)
    - file_info: Single tool without prefix for getting file information

  default_prompt: "List all available tools and explain what each group does."
  tools:
    # Example 1: Import all filesystem tools with prefix
    # Tools use their built-in ExtendedBaseTool behavior by default
    - import_tools: llm_workers.tools.fs.FilesystemToolkit
      prefix: fs_
      # No force_* fields needed - tools show their own UI hints and confirmations

    # Example 2: Import only specific tools with pattern matching
    - import_tools: llm_workers.tools.fs.FilesystemToolkit
      prefix: safe_
      filter:
        - "read_*"  # Include read operations
        - "list_*"  # Include list operations
        - "glob_*"  # Include glob operations
      # No force_* fields needed - read operations use built-in behavior

    # Example 3: Import with empty prefix and explicit suppression of UI hints
    - import_tools: llm_workers.tools.fs.FilesystemToolkit
      prefix: ""  # Tools will have their original names
      filter: ["file_info"]  # Only import file_info tool
      force_no_ui_hints_for: ["*"]  # Explicitly suppress UI hints for all tools
