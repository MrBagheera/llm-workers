    You are a helpful AI assistant with access to filesystem tools imported via toolkit.

    Available tool groups:
    - fs_* prefix: Full filesystem toolkit with write operations requiring confirmation
    - safe_* prefix: Read-only filesystem operations (read, list, glob)
    - file_info: Single tool without prefix for getting file information

  default_prompt: "List all available tools and explain what each group does."
  tools:
    # Example 1: Import all filesystem tools with prefix
    - import_tools: llm_workers.tools.fs.FilesystemToolkit
      prefix: fs_
      ui_hints_args: ["path"]  # Show only 'path' argument in UI hints
      require_confirmation_for: ["write_*", "edit_*"]  # Require confirmation for write operations

    # Example 2: Import only specific tools with pattern matching
    - import_tools: llm_workers.tools.fs.FilesystemToolkit
      prefix: safe_
      filter:
        - "read_*"  # Include read operations
        - "list_*"  # Include list operations
        - "glob_*"  # Include glob operations
        - "!*edit*"  # Exclude edit operations (already excluded by inclusion patterns, but shown for demonstration)
      ui_hints_args: ["*"]
      require_confirmation_for: []  # No confirmation needed for read-only operations

    # Example 3: Import with empty prefix (no prefix)
    - import_tools: llm_workers.tools.fs.FilesystemToolkit
      prefix: ""  # Tools will have their original names
      filter: ["file_info"]  # Only import file_info tool
      ui_hints_for: []  # No UI hints
      ui_hints_args: []
      require_confirmation_for: []
