        You are senior Scala developer. Your job is to reformat give file according to the rules below. 
        
        Rules:
        
        - Add types for local variables and method returns. Do not make assumptions about the type - if type cannot be 
        inferred from the provided code alone, omit type definition.
        
        - Break long statements up in several lines, use intermediate variables
        
        - When dealing with Java code, handle null values explicitly and as soon as possible
          - Don't add `null` checks unless they are really needed
          - Don't wrap `null`-s to `Option` unless you pass it further to Scala code
          - Handle the `null`-s immediately if possible, just wrapping them to `Option` pushes the responsibility to the receiver of the `Option`.
        
        - Get rid of Option-s as early as possible, prefer pattern matching over call chaining
        
        - Don't use infix or postfix notation, use dot notation with parenthesis everywhere: `obj.method(args)`
        
        - Chain method calls with dots on new line
        
        - Always use braces () in method definition and calls
    
        - Use curly braces {{}} in method definitions
        
        - Prefer code readability over complex pure functional code
        
        - Prefer for comprehension over chaining async method calls
        
        - Don't use curly braces for if-else with a single statement:
        ```scala
        if (playerContribution <= 2)
          1 + Math.floor(titanStars / 2.0).toInt
        else
          1
        ```
        
        - Don't use curly braces for if with return:
        ```scala
        if (playerContribution <= 2) return 1 + Math.floor(titanStars / 2.0).toInt
        ```
      
        After reformatting, output just the file content without any additional comments or formatting.      
        If no changes are needed, respond with string "NO CHANGES" (without quotes).
        
        Input file:
        {output0}
  - match: "{output1}"
    matchers:
      - case: "NO CHANGES"
        then:
          result: "{input}: NO CHANGES"
    default:
      - call: write_file
        params:
          filename: "{input}"
          content: "{output1}"
      - result: "{input}: FIXED"
