# The idea is that we have a tool that provides help on fixed list of topics, and we rely on LLM

      Player data is stored as big JSON object in the database and has unique identifier.
      
      Here is Pydantic class describing most important fields of player JSON:
      ```python
      class GooglePlayLogin(BaseModel):
          id: str
          encrypted_name: str
      
      class GameCenterLogin(BaseModel):
          id: str
          encrypted_name: str
      
      class RegisteredInfo(BaseModel):
          timestamp: datetime
          platform: str
          country: str
      
      class Player(BaseModel):
          id: str = Field(alias="_id")
          google_play_login: Optional[GooglePlayLogin]
          game_center_login: Optional[GameCenterLogin]
          version: int
          progress: GameProgress
          progress_hash: int
          progress_version: int
          last_active: datetime
          language: Optional[str] = None
          registered: Optional[RegisteredInfo] = None
          pending_ops: Dict[str, Any] = Field(default={{}})
          last_updated: datetime
      ```
    game_progress: |-
      The data describing player's progress through the game is often referred to as "game progress" or `GameProgress`.
      
      `GameProgress` is stored both on the client and on the server, and is updated sequentially via operations.
      
      Here is Pydantic class describing most important fields of game progress JSON:
       ```python
      class GameProgress(BaseModel):
        config_id: int
        resource1: int
        coins: int
        resource2: int
        random: DeterministicRandom
        resource3: int
        seen_trophies: int
        time: int
        trophies: int
        # many other fields
      ```

    operations: |-
      Player's game progress is updated via sequentially applied operations. 
      
      Most important fields of operations JSON:
      ```python
      class Operation(BaseModel):
          operation_type: str
          time: int
          hash: int
          # Additional fields depend on the operation type

    progress_logs: |-
      Each operation applied to game progress results in progress log record.
      
      Most important fields of progress log JSON:
      ```python
      class ProgressDiffItem(BaseModel):
          was: Any
          now: Any
      
      class ProgressLog(BaseModel):
          operation: Operation
          player_id: str
          progress_version: int
          timestamp: datetime
          progress_diff: Dict[str, Any] # contains nested dictionaries and lists with ProgressDiffItem for changed field  
      ```

    You are AI assistant in a mobile game company.
    
    Your team is investigating issues in a live game. Your task is to help your team by writing 
    and running Python scripts to fetch and connect data from various sources.
    
    Unless explicitly asked by user, write script result to promptly named file in the current directory,
    output only progress information and file name. Prefer '.json' as output format.
    
    If unsure about the requirements or data format, DO NOT MAKE ASSUMPTIONS. 
    Use `read_docs` tool to get more information on topics related to user's request. 
    Call it ONLY ONCE FOR EACH TOPIC per session. If still unsure, ask for user for clarification.
  default_prompt: |-
    Please write Python script to read file `players.json` that contains a list of player JSON records, and print only 
    IDs of those who have game center logins and have more than 1000 gems.
